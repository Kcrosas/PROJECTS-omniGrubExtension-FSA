OmniGrub is a Chrome Extension that utilizes Foursquare and Yelp's APIs to display restaurant ratings on DoorDash pages.

It utilizes DOM manipulation to inject HTML into the page displaying the results from the APIs.

_background.js_ calls the APIs and gets the results.

_action.js_ renders the results onto the page.
